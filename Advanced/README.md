Secure Messaging Application: Develop an end-to-end encrypted messaging application, incorporating modern cryptographic principles and protocols like the Signal Protocol. This project challenges you to ensure secure data transmission over networks and manage cryptographic keys properly.

Fuzz Testing Framework: Build a framework for fuzz testing that can automatically generate random data to test programs and find potential security issues. This advanced project requires in-depth knowledge of Rust's unsafe code features and memory management to manipulate data structures and algorithms for test case generation.

Custom Cryptographic Protocol Implementation: Implement a new or existing cryptographic protocol from scratch. This could involve complex cryptographic algorithms and their secure implementation, offering a deep dive into Rust's performance optimizations and safety guarantees.
