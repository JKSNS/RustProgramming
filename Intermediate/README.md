Web Application Firewall (WAF): Build a simple WAF to protect web applications from common attacks such as SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF. This project can involve parsing and analyzing HTTP requests, which will deepen your understanding of web protocols and how to apply security measures.

Intrusion Detection System (IDS): Implement an IDS that monitors network or system activities for malicious actions or policy violations. This project will introduce you to network packet capture and analysis in Rust, requiring familiarity with libraries like libpnet.

Blockchain-based Authentication System: Create a decentralized authentication system using blockchain technology. This project allows you to explore blockchain principles, Rust's concurrency model, and how to integrate Rust applications with databases.
